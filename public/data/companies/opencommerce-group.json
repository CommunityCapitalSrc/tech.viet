Due to the diversity of cultures, governments, and laws, small and medium-sized enterprises are dealing with a lot of problems related to product quality shipping time, customers service, cash flow, etc. Cross-border trade takes place in large volumes, though.\n\nOur ecosystem aims at promoting and enhancing cross-border trade, which empowers online entrepreneurs to start, grow and succeed.",
