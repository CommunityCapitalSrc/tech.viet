The Firm's private equity strategy was launched in 2003. This strategy has a ten-year investment horizon and targets growth-oriented private companies from early to late stages, with an emphasis on businesses based in the U.S., China and India. \n\nThe Firm's public equity business, founded in 2001, conducts deep fundamental research on our focus industries and geographies and seeks to make long-term investments in the companies we believe are best positioned to offer the highest returns. Both of our strategies have generated meaningful risk-adjusted returns since inception.\n\nTiger Global has a relatively small investment team and seeks to hire the most talented people we can find across every function of the Firm. We pride ourselves on the quality of the work we complete and our ability to continue learning and improving. As a Firm, we value long-term thinking, intellectual honesty, continuous improvement, all-in commitment, teamwork, and self-awareness. In everything we do, we strive to be world class and to conduct ourselves with the highest integrity. \n\nTiger Global is based in New York with affiliate offices in Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and Bangalore.", "location": "United States", "founded": "2001", "facebook": "", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/tiger-global-management/", "crunchbase": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global", "portfolio": "", "logoUrl": "/img/investor/tiger-global-management-avatar.png"}
