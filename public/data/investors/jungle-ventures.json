{"name": "Jungle Ventures", "slug": "jungle-ventures", "type": "Venture Capital", "website": "https://www.jungle.vc/", "description": "We started Jungle in 2011 with the goal of creating a different kind of venture capital firm, by not trying to be everything to everyone. We have done this by focusing on fewer investments than our peers and only targeting entrepreneurs who have ambitions to build regional if not global category leaders. \n\nWe also invested in building a team that has more than 100 years of actual operating experience and diverse networks in the region, with a deep commitment to helping the few entrepreneurs that we back every year. This has helped our founders be more effective at early stages with Jungle providing steady access to longer term capital and relevant market expansion expertise.\n\nJungle invests in three macro themes- digital brands serving the young consumers of Asia, technology platforms that help Asian SME's adopt technology and disruptive technology ideas with global potential. We are proud to have been the earliest backers of companies such as Livspace, Reddoorz, Pomelo, Kredivo, TookiTaki, Deskera, Sociolla amongst others.", "location": "Singapore", "founded": "2011", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/JungleVentures", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/jungle-ventures/", "crunchbase": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jungle-ventures", "portfolio": "https://www.jungle.vc/portfolio", "logoUrl": "/img/investor/jungle-ventures-avatar.png"}
