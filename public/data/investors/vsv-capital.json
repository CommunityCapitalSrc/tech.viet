The project was called Vietnam Silicon Valley (or \"Project Commercialization of Technology Following the Silicon Valley Model in Vietnam\" in Vietnamese), and widely known as just VSV. By combining the Vietnamese entrepreneurial spirit and innovative nature with proven practices that Silicon Valley has to offer in startup acceleration and investment, it sought to create an ecosystem of innovation and technology commercialization in Vietnam. The project marked the beginning of a dynamic and exciting era for startup and entrepreneurship in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2014, the team behind Project VSV founded Vietnam Silicon Valley Accelerator, or VSVA, making it the first startup accelerator in Vietnam, to continue their mission in developing the Vietnam startup ecosystem. Over the past years, we have helped hundreds of entrepreneurs build their companies and raise millions of dollars in their next rounds of funding.\n\nIn 2019, to further draw attention to startups at the most highly potential but also highly underserved segment in Vietnam, we raised our first venture fund in addition to our accelerator fund, and started operating under the name VSV Capital.", "location": "Vietnam", "founded": "2014", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/VSVCapital/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/vsvcapital/", "crunchbase": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vietnam-silicon-valley", "portfolio": "https://www.vsvcapital.com.vn/portfolio", "logoUrl": "/img/investor/vsv-capital-avatar.png"}
