  "description": "Southeast Asian VC Fund with Vietnam focus.\n\nTouchstone Partners envisions a community where local and foreign future technologists and business leaders convene in Vietnam and creating positive impact. We look for and invest into mission-driven founders with deep expertise in their industry and possess a constant, resilient and thoughtful drive to give back to Vietnam.\n\nAt the end of the day, we ask, \"When the startup succeeds, what difference will it make to Vietnam?\". As proud parents and siblings, we want to leave Vietnam a better place for our children and future generations.\n\nWith a combination of know-hows and know-whos, we can do that. This is why Touchstone Partners exists; to set the next level of standards in venture investing in Vietnam.",
