  "description": "Do Ventures is an early-stage VC firm that focuses on making investments in technology companies in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. We look for pioneers with a desire to create disruptive products that can bring about outstanding values to the society.\n\nOur Philosophy is Grow by Doing. We believe that entrepreneurs who are willing to do more tend to make more right decisions. Luck originates from resilience and persistence. Those who work harder will have more chances to encounter luck in their career path\n\nAt Do Ventures, we believe that failing is equally important to do the right things. Success can frequently be taken for granted, but failure is a remarkable opportunity to learn.\n\nTherefore, we highly encourage our talented entrepreneurs to take risks, challenge themselves, and extend their visions beyond the usual boundary. Our ultimate goal is to discover daring founders and nurture them into PIONEERS in their fields to form new consumer behaviors.",
