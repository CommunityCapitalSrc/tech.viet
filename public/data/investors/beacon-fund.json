{"name": "Beacon Fund", "slug": "beacon-fund", "type": "Venture Capital", "website": "https://beaconfund.com/", "description": "Beacon Fund is a long-term commitment to changing finance to work better for female entrepreneurs. Most of these businesses are not the ‘blitz-scaling’ (often cash-incinerating) companies targeted by traditional VC firms - and that's not a problem, it’s an opportunity. Beacon aims to contribute to closing the gender financing gap by providing appropriate capital and support to sustainable, moderate growth companies which are not a good fit for the traditional VC model and severely underserved by banks. In doing so, Beacon hopes to shine a light on alternative models and entrepreneurial success.\n\nWe provide fit-for-purpose financing for women-owned businesses and businesses that primarily and intentionally serve women and girls. Our geographic focus is Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, with opportunistic investments elsewhere in Southeast Asia.", "location": "Vietnam", "founded": "2020", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/beaconfund/", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/beaconfund/", "crunchbase": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/beacon-fund", "portfolio": "https://beaconfund.com/our-portfolio", "logoUrl": "/img/investor/beacon-fund-avatar.png"}
