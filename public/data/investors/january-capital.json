  "description": "January Capital invests in second-order businesses that are powering growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nCompany stage\nWe wish to invest at stages in a companyâ€™s lifecycle where our capital and experience can be most impactful. We focus on investing from the Pre-Seed to Series B equity financing stage. We invest between $0.25 - $5 million as an initial check but have the capacity to invest substantially more over time. We have invested more than $25 million over the course of our partnership with portfolio companies.\n\nCompany geography\nWe invest in the following markets: Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, and New Zealand. We selectively consider other markets (in particular, India and North America) but only where we can add tangible value. We prefer 'pan-regional' or 'multi-market' businesses with significant ambition. We are comfortable with companies that are capital intensive if their unit economics are viable. We have experience investing in businesses that have global ambitions but may be starting their journey in one of our focus markets.",
