  "description": "Phoenix Holdings is a pioneering family investment office in Vietnam. We apply “Built-to-Last” thinking, based on our observations that the most successful VC-PE investments are in companies built on the quality of endurance. That is how we approach, attract and build with best-in-class entrepreneurs in their respective fields of the startup ecosystem.\n\nPhoenix's DNA is the culmination of Mr. Henry Nguyen - its founder's long history in both traditional finance and high-tech ventures. Phoenix covers the entire financial services value chain, including a commercial bank, a consumer finance company, an asset management company, a securities brokerage and more. These licensed \"Brick & Mortar\" businesses all operate under their own professional management teams and are heavily focused on growing in their respective segments. This \"traditional\" side of the business is complemented with tech-backed ventures including a Digital Bank, a BNPL, a Payment Company, a Micro SME Lending Company, a P2P Lending Company as well as a wide range of other companies within the Phoenix ecosystem.\n\nIn short, we believe Vietnam's billion-dollar opportunity to be less in pure disruption through Fintech and more in the convergence of Fintech and conventional finance, underpinned by being fully licensed with regulatory compliance. Aside from the previously mentioned businesses in the financial sector, our portfolio includes business in F&B/Consumer as well (McDonald's). Some of our tech-backed ventures include Timo (Digital Bank), Kredivo Vietnam (BNPL), Moca (Payment Company) and Interloan (P2P Lending Platform).",
